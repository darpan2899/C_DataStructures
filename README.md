# C_DataStructures
These programs were implemented as an approach to get better understanding of datastructures used in C programming language.
There are basically 2 types of datastructures Linear and Non-Linear.
There are 2 types of Linear datastructures i.e Linear ds with continuous allocation(like Array,Stack and Queue) and Linear ds with non continuous allocation (like Linked List)
